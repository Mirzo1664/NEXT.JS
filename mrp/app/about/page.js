                        <p>
                            MRP was founded in 2010 and has become one of the most successful companies in our country.
                            Like many Italian companies, MRP remains a family business, although no family member is a designer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We follow a successful formula, working with renowned designers to create our collections.
                            This method was described by fashion critic Colin McDowell as a form of design co-creation,
                            typical for many Italian pr√™t-√†-porter brands.

                        <p>
                            The first MRP store opened in a small town in the eastern part of the country in 2010.
                            The first collection consisted of two coats and a suit that were replicas of famous designs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although the founder was a lawyer by education, her family had deep roots in tailoring:
                            her great-grandmother made clothes for women, and her mother opened a professional sewing school.
                            The ambition to create clothing for the masses carried huge potential‚Äîespecially at a time
                            when high fashion still dominated and the quality pr√™t-√†-porter market hardly existed.
